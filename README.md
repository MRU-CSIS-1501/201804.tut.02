# Tut-02

## WHAT WE'RE DOING

Your instructor will talk about 10 minutes:

- where to find outstanding issues with assignments
- do you know that you can find suggested solutions for the REPLs?
- did you call methods in lab-01 : calling-methods : 02?
- String concatenation
- casting ints to chars

Making sure you can post questions (and answers) to Google Classroom

Getting Java practice with

- order of operations
- writing mathematical expressions in Java
- integer arithmetic
- Strings

---

## POST TO GOOGLE CLASSROOM

1. Log in to Google Classroom: https://classroom.google.com/u/1/c/MTUxMTUxMzg4MTFa
2. Post one question to the "Do you have any questions about anything else?" "forum"
3. Answer another person's question in the same location

## ORDER OF OPERATIONS & MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION IN JAVA

1. Get on INS
1. Make a directory `tut-02`
1. Do the next two practices

### PRACTICE: ORDER OF OPERATIONS

On INS, create a file called `order-of-ops.txt` in `tut-02`.

In that file, write down what numbers you think Java will produce when it evaluates these expressions.

<pre>
a) -15.0 * 3.0 + 4.0
b) -2.0 * (20.0 / 4.0 + 1.0) + 5.0
c) 4.0 * 3.0 / 6.0
d) 4.0 / 6.0 * 3.0
e) 4 + 7 / 3 – 5
f) 3 * 4 / 6
g) 4 + 7 % 3 – 5
h) (4 + 7) % 3 – 5
</pre>

Save your work.

Check your work - you can use REPL.IT to do so.

How many did you get correct? If you got any wrong, do you see what went wrong?


### PRACTICE: WRITING MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS IN JAVA

On INS, create a file called `writing-expressions.txt` in `tut-02`.

Write legal Java arithmetic expressions for the following - you can choose whatever numbers you want for the variables in that expression (for example, for XY²Z, you could just choose 3 for X, 4 for Y, and -3 for Z):

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A%20+%20%5Cfrac%7BB%7D%7BC%20+%20D%7D)

(X - 1)(Y - 4)

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B-B%20+%20X%7D%7B2A%7D)

XY²Z

Save your work.

Check your work - you can use REPL.IT to do so.

How many did you get correct? If you got any wrong, do you see what went wrong?


### SUBMIT

Please submit the `tut-02` folder as **tut02** using `submit1501`.
