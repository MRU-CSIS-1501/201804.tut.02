# Tut-02

## WHAT WE'RE DOING

Getting practice with

- order of operations
- writing mathematical expressions in Java
- integer arithmetic
- Strings

---

## GET READY

1. Get on INS
1. Make a directory `tut-02`

---

## PRACTICE: ORDER OF OPERATIONS

On INS, create a file called `order-of-ops.txt` in `tut-02`.

In that file, write down what numbers you think Java will produce when it evaluates these expressions.

<pre>
a) -15.0 * 3.0 + 4.0
b) -2.0 * (20.0 / 4.0 + 1.0) + 5.0
c) 4.0 * 3.0 / 6.0
d) 4.0 / 6.0 * 3.0
e) 4 + 7 / 3 – 5
f) 3 * 4 / 6
g) 4 + 7 % 3 – 5
h) (4 + 7) % 3 – 5
</pre>

Save your work.

Check your work - you can use REPL.IT to do so.

How many did you get correct? If you got any wrong, do you see what went wrong?

## PRACTICE: WRITING MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS IN JAVA

On INS, create a file called `writing-expressions.txt` in `tut-02`.

Write legal Java arithmetic expressions for the following:

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A%20+%20%5Cfrac%7BB%7D%7BC%20+%20D%7D)

(X - 1)(Y - 4)

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B-B%20+%20X%7D%7B2A%7D)

XY²Z
